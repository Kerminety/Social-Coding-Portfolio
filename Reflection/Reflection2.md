Activity 2 included code types that were difficult for me to understand at first, but I got the hang of them quickly. I used Melanie Walsh's Python basics GitHub to get the basis for the codes which helped out a decent amount but also used YouTube in order to understand better. Overall I think I did a decent job understanding the questions and learning how they work, I do seem to struggle a bit overall but for the most part, I've got it down. However, the more I worked and played around with the material throughout the activity, the more I could see myself understanding what I should be doing for every problem.
